Code for calculating Background Rates. The R-file "SIR_function.R" contains both the function SIR_fun(...) which is used to calculate the 
Standardized Incidence Rate Ratios and a detailed description of the required inputs. "SIR_function.R" also contains a simulated example which is used
to show the use-cases of SIR_fun(...) along with the available options.
